# changelog-ui
This is a static HTML website that I've created to display a changelog as a part of the following learning project https://roadmap.sh/projects/changelog-component

To run this, once you've cloned or downloaded this repo, double-click on the .html file that is present in the repository, or you can open it via VS Code and use the live server extension to run it, where you can make changes to it if required
